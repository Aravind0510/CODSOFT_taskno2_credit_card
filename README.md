# CodSoft-Tasks

The tasks that has to be completed to finish the internship CodSoft offered:
The Machine Learning tasks that we chose to complete are :
1. Credit Card Fraud Detection


# credit_card
The objective of this task is straight forward. To find whether a particular credit card transaction reeks of malpractice of any sort. The dataset provided contains typical transaction details such as date, name, location, etc. Our first step lies in choosing which attributes is most useful in predicting the fraud. Hence we used correlation analysis and some domain knowledge to determine which attributes is important and seperated for training it. The model that we used for this is Random Forest Classifier. We did a textbook training and testing and finally predicting the results. The accuracy of our model comes close to 99%.
